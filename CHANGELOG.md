# Changelog for flexi_logger

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.0] - 2019-04-18

Suppport different formatting for stderr and files.

Add feature `colors` (see `README.md` for details).

Remove the deprecated `Logger::start_reconfigurable()`.

## [0.11.4] - 2019-04-01

Version updates of dependencies.

## [0.11.3] - 2019-03-28

Add SyslogWriter.

## [0.11.2] - 2019-03-22

Change API to more idiomatic parameter types, in a compatible way.

Add first implementation of a SyslogWriter.

## [0.11.1] - 2019-03-06

Add option to write windows line endings, rather than a plain `\n`.

## [0.11.0] - 2019-03-02

Add options to cleanup rotated log files, by deleting and/or zipping older files.

Remove some deprecated methods.

## [0.10.7] - 2019-02-27

Let the BlackHoleLogger, although it doesn't write a log, still duplicate to stderr.

## [0.10.6] - 2019-02-26

Deprecate `Logger::start_reconfigurable()`, let `Logger::start()` return a reconfiguration handle.

Add an option to write all logs to nowhere (i.e., do not write any logs).

## [0.10.5] - 2019-01-15

Eliminate performance penalty for using reconfigurability.

## [0.10.4] - 2019-01-07

Add methods to modify the log spec temporarily.

## [0.10.3] - 2018-12-08

Advance to edition 2018.

## [0.10.2] - 2018-12-07

Log-spec parsing is improved, more whitespace is tolerated.

## [0.10.1] - 2018-11-08

When file rotation is used, the name of the file to which the logs are written is now stable.

Details:

* the logs are always written to a file with infix _rCURRENT
* if this file exceeds the specified rotate-over-size, it is closed and renamed to a file with a sequential number infix, and then the logging continues again to the (fresh) file with infix _rCURRENT

Example:

After some logging with your program my_prog, you will find files like

```text
my_prog_r00000.log
my_prog_r00001.log
my_prog_r00002.log
my_prog_rCURRENT.log
```

## [0.10.0] - 2018-10-30

`LogSpecification::parse()` now returns a `Result<LogSpecification, FlexiLoggerError>`, rather than
a log spec directly (-> version bump).
This enables a more reliable usage of FlexiLogger in non-trivial cases.

For the sake of compatibility for the normal usecases, the Logger methods `with_str()` etc.
remain unchanged. An extra method is added to retrieve parser errors, if desired.

## [0.9.3] - 2018-10-27

Docu improvement.

## [0.9.2] - 2018-08-13

Fix incorrect filename generation with rotation,
i.e., switch off timestamp usage when rotation is used.

## [0.9.1] - 2018-08-12

Introduce `Logger::duplicate_to_stderr()`, as a more flexible replacement for `duplicate_error()`
and `duplicate_info()`.

## [0.9.0] - 2018-07-06

### Eliminate String allocation

Get rid of the unneccessary String allocation we've been
carrying with us since ages. This implies changing the signature of the format functions.

In case you provide your own format function, you'll need to adapt it to the new signature.
Luckily, the effort is low.

As an example, here is how the definition of the `opt_format` function changed:

```rust
- pub fn opt_format(record: &Record) -> String {
-     format!(
---
+ pub fn opt_format(w: &mut io::Write, record: &Record) -> Result<(), io::Error> {
+     write!(
+         w,
```

Similarly, if you're using the advanced feature of providing your own implementation of LogWriter,
you need to adapt it. The change again is trivial, and should even slightly
simplify your code (you can return io errors and don't have to catch them yourself).

### Misc

The docu generation on docs.rs is now configured to considers all features, we thus
expose `Logger.start_with_specfile()` only if the specfile feature is used. So we can revert the
change done with 0.8.1.

## [0.8.4] - 2018-06-18

Add flexi_logger to category `development-tools::debugging`

## [0.8.3] - 2018-05-14

Make append() also work for rotating log files

## [0.8.2] - 2018-04-03

Add option to append to existing log files, rather than always truncating them

## [0.8.1] - 2018-3-19

Expose `Logger.start_with_specfile()` always
...and not only if the feature "specfile" is used - otherwise it does not appear
in the auto-generated docu (because it does not use --allfeatures)

## [0.8.0] - 2018-03-18

Add specfile feature

* Add a feature that allows to specify the LogSpecification via a file
  that can be edited while the program is running
* Remove/hide deprecated APIs
* As a consequence, cleanup code, get rid of duplicate stuff.

## [0.7.1] - 2018-03-07

Bugfix: do not create empty files when used in env_logger style.
Update docu and the description in cargo.toml

## [0.7.0] - 2018-02-25

Add support for multiple log output streams

* replace FlexiWriter with DefaultLogWriter, which wraps a FileLogWriter
* add test where a SecurityWriter and an AlertWriter are added
* add docu
* move deprecated structs to separate package
* move benches to folder benches

## [0.6.13] 2018-02-09

Add Logger::with_env_or_str()

## [0.6.12] 2018-2-07

Add ReconfigurationHandle::parse_new_spec()

## [0.6.11] 2017-12-29

Fix README.md

## [0.6.10] 2017-12-29

Publish version based on log 0.4

## (...)

## [0.6.0] 2017-07-13

Use builder pattern for LogSpecification and Logger

* deprecate outdated API
* "objectify" LogSpecification
* improve documentation, e.g. document the dash/underscore issue
